Did some preliminary analysis on the data. 

Files:

- data_analysis.html: can be opened by a browser.

- data_analysis.ipynb: needs to install Jupyter Notebook to open it. It is OK if you do not have it installed, because all the content of this file can be viewed in data_analysis.html, which can be opened by a browser. 

For some reason, anaconda is not working in my computer. 
So for this moment, I can only use pandas in the notebook file (the .ipynb file), instead of a normal python program .py file. 
I can move the code from this notebook to a normal .py file once I fix the anaconda problem. 
However, the benefit of this notebook file is that it is convenient to visualize data. Many of the kernel posts also use notebooks. 
This file uses Python 2 syntax (I have problem using Python 3 with pandas).
